        "title" => "How are LLMs trained?",
        "description" => "LLMs are trained on large datasets that include text from a variety of sources, such as books, websites, and articles. During training, the model learns patterns in the text, enabling it to predict the next word in a sequence, understand context, and generate coherent responses."

        "description" => "While LLMs are powerful tools, they are not a direct replacement for human expertise. They excel in generating content quickly and assisting with repetitive tasks, but they still require human oversight, especially for creative writing, complex problem-solving, and tasks requiring deep contextual understanding."

        "title" => "Are LLMs safe to use in production environments?",
        "description" => "LLMs are generally safe when used with proper controls. However, they may sometimes produce inaccurate or biased outputs due to the data they were trained on. It's important to implement safety checks and guidelines when using LLMs, especially in sensitive applications."
